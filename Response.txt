Six response sets (Video A = sharp 90°, Video B = smooth 90°)
Participant 1

Video A (sharp) — Q1: 3
Q2: The snap turn felt jerky and a bit unpredictable. I’d worry about it clipping a corner near my feet.

Video B (smooth) — Q1: 6
Q2: The gradual arc looked controlled and easier to anticipate. It seemed like it would steer around people more safely.

Participant 2

Video A (sharp) — Q1: 4
Q2: It was quick and efficient, but the sudden heading change made me tense. The speed was fine; the turn itself felt abrupt.

Video B (smooth) — Q1: 6
Q2: The curve gave me time to read its intent. Smooth motion = more predictable path.

Participant 3

Video A (sharp) — Q1: 2
Q2: Looked like it “snapped” without warning. If I were nearby, I’d step back.

Video B (smooth) — Q1: 7
Q2: Very clear where it was going the whole time. No surprises, so I’d trust it more.

Participant 4

Video A (sharp) — Q1: 5
Q2: I actually liked the decisiveness. Still, it pivoted fast enough that I’d want some buffer space.

Video B (smooth) — Q1: 5
Q2: Smoother, but also slower to complete the corner. Feels safe, but not dramatically safer than A to me.

Participant 5

Video A (sharp) — Q1: 3
Q2: The corner looked “snappy” and slightly wobbly after the turn. That made it feel less stable.

Video B (smooth) — Q1: 6
Q2: The bot held a steady arc with no wobble. Seemed like better traction and control.

Participant 6

Video A (sharp) — Q1: 4
Q2: Fine in open space, but near people I’d prefer gentler turns. The abrupt heading change is hard to anticipate.

Video B (smooth) — Q1: 7
Q2: Clear intent and consistent speed through the turn. I could easily predict its path and keep out of the way.
